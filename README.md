The problem weâ€™re tackling is clustering the faces of characters from The Simpsons and figuring out how to map a third-party face image to Simpsons faces at different angles. In this project, we used PCA on RBG images of the Simpsons and tried reconstructing using different methods. We tried both Unsupervised learning using k-means clustering and supervised learning using SVMs. Lastly, we tried mapping the top 7 principle components to human faces.

While the results weren't perfect, the most valuable lessons came from the mistakes and bloopers we made along the way!
